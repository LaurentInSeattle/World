    Limits to Growth: 
    
    This is a re-implementation in C# of World3, the social-economic-environmental model created by
    Dennis and Donella Meadows and others circa 1970. The results of the modeling exercise were published in The Limits to Growth
    in 1972, and the model itself was more fully documented in Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World in 1974.

    Original Comments by Brian Hayes, circa 2012 

        The Limits to Growth_ by Meadows et al. (1972) presented a system dynamics model of the global ecosystem and economy, called World3.
        The original simulation was written in a language called DYNAMO. 
        The code in this repository, written in 2012, attempts to translate the DYNAMO World3 program into JavaScript.
